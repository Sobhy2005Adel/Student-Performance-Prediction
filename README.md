# 🎓 Student Performance Prediction

This project is a binary classification task to predict whether a student will pass or fail based on their features like study time, absences, and demographic information.

---

## 📌 Objective

- Predict student performance (pass/fail) using machine learning classification models.

---

## ⚙️ Project Workflow

1. **Data Preprocessing**  
   - Handle missing values and duplicates  
   - Encode categorical variables (e.g., gender, address)

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   - Summary statistics  
   - Visualizations of key features vs. pass/fail outcome

3. **Modeling**  
   - Train a classification model (e.g., Logistic Regression)
   - Evaluate using:
     - Accuracy
     - Precision
     - Recall
     - Confusion Matrix
